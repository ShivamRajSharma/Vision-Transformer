# Vision-Transformer On CIFAR-10

PyTorch Implementation of ViT (Vision Transformer), an transformer based architecture for Computer-Vision tasks. In ViT the author converts an image into 16x16 patche embedding achieving State Of the Art performance on all Computer-Vision task.

In this repository ViT if trained on CIFAR-10 dataset
