# Vision-Transformer On CIFAR-10

PyTorch Implementation of ViT (Vision Transformer), an transformer based architecture for Computer-Vision tasks. In ViT the author converts an image into 16x16 patche embedding and applies visual transformers to find relationships between visual semantic concepts. The ViT achieves State Of the Art performance on all Computer-Vision task.
